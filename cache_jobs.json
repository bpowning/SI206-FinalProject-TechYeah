Candidates applying to this requisition should be prepared to explain during a phone interview which research team interests them, why, and what qualifications they have that would suit that team.</p>\n<p>Senior Research Engineers on these teams are responsible for engineering and/or software design, implementation, analysis, and maintenance or experimentation. They assist the Principal Investigator (PI) and System Architect with development and maintenance of discipline-specific software systems and/or engineering tools to support project and research goals through collaboration on a team of Research Engineers and Research Scientists.</p>\n<p>ESTCP Research Team\nThe ESTCP team's current project involves transitioning future \"Smart Grid\" management from a centralized to a coordinated and distributed control paradigm, specifically, using an integrated microgrid. Microgrids, with local power generation and storage capability, can greatly reduce dependence on large utilities while providing sufficiently reliable power to communities. However, microgrids need intelligent and distributed control systems to manage various modes of operations and to provide a stable energy supply. This project is developing an open source microgrid control system that runs on a network of small embedded devices attached to the microgrid power system components (photovoltaic cells, batteries, residential loads, etc.) The ultimate goal is to build field-tested, generic control system software that is highly customizable and can be widely used in various microgrid systems.</p>\n<p>MIDAS Research Team\nThe MIDAS team's current project involves developing a new approach to evolutionary software development and deployment that extends the results of model-based software engineering. The project will construct an integrated, end-to-end framework for building software that is focused on growth and adaptation. The envisioned technology is based on the concept of a \u2018Model Design Language\u2019 (MDL) that supports the expression of the developer\u2019s objectives (the \u2018what\u2019), intentions (the \u2018how\u2019), and constraints (the \u2018limitations\u2019) related to the software artifacts to be produced. The \u2018models\u2019 represented in this language are called the \u2018design models\u2019 for the software artifact(s) and they encompass more than what we express today in software models like UML. We consider software development as a continuous process, as in the DevOps paradigm, where the software is undergoing continuous change, improvement, and extension; and our goal is to build the tools to support this. The main idea is that changes in the requirements will result in the designer/developer making changes in the \u2018design model\u2019 that will result in automatically generated changes in the generated artifacts, or changes in the target system, at run-time, as needed.</p>\n<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assist with modeling and analysis of discipline-specific engineering problems.</li>\n<li>Assist PI and/or System Architect with the development and maintenance of discipline-specific software systems and/or engineering tools to support project and research goals.</li>\n<li>Perform engineering and/or software design, implementation, analysis, maintenance, or experimentation as directed by PI and lead Engineers.</li>\n<li>Adhere to existing technical standards and recommend or develop new standards, as applicable.</li>\n<li>Prepare technical documentation for work products of project.</li>\n<li>Maintain familiarity with and expertise in emerging technologies and techniques related to project and research goals.</li>\n<li>Provide PI and /or System Architect with accurate documentation of all systems within project research area of direct involvement or responsibility.</li>\n<li>Provide PI and/or System Architect with data to assist in evaluation of project research direction and progress, providing input on solutions as necessary.</li>\n<li>Provide PI and /or System Architect with daily documentation of work performed.</li>\n<li>Effectively deliver technical progress reports and presentations in written and oral forms to project research staff and faculty.</li>\n<li>Communicate regularly, effectively, and professionally with PI, System Architect, and research team.</li>\n<li>Share research knowledge, product, and processes with PI, System Architect, and research team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Profile of an Ideal Candidate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Bachelor\u2019s Degree in computer science or engineering is necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following skills are necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solid, established skills in software system development, modeling, and/or systems engineering.</li>\n<li>Ability to design, implement, test, document, and maintain software.</li>\n<li>Practical knowledge of software development tools, programming languages (e.g., C/C++, Java, Python, Matlab, C#, among others), databases, and web technologies, as needed by project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following skills are a plus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with the development of embedded systems.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of basics of machine learning techniques.</li>\n<li>Familiarity with the concepts of autonomy and autonomous cyber-physical systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commitment to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\nVanderbilt University is committed to achieving the goal of a diverse and inclusive academic community of faculty, staff, and students.

Candidates applying to this requisition should be prepared to explain during a phone interview which research team interests them, why, and what qualifications they have that would suit that team.</p>\n<p>Senior Research Engineers on these teams are responsible for engineering and/or software design, implementation, analysis, and maintenance or experimentation. They assist the Principal Investigator (PI) and System Architect with development and maintenance of discipline-specific software systems and/or engineering tools to support project and research goals through collaboration on a team of Research Engineers and Research Scientists.</p>\n<p>ESTCP Research Team\nThe ESTCP team's current project involves transitioning future \"Smart Grid\" management from a centralized to a coordinated and distributed control paradigm, specifically, using an integrated microgrid. Microgrids, with local power generation and storage capability, can greatly reduce dependence on large utilities while providing sufficiently reliable power to communities. However, microgrids need intelligent and distributed control systems to manage various modes of operations and to provide a stable energy supply. This project is developing an open source microgrid control system that runs on a network of small embedded devices attached to the microgrid power system components (photovoltaic cells, batteries, residential loads, etc.) The ultimate goal is to build field-tested, generic control system software that is highly customizable and can be widely used in various microgrid systems.</p>\n<p>MIDAS Research Team\nThe MIDAS team's current project involves developing a new approach to evolutionary software development and deployment that extends the results of model-based software engineering. The project will construct an integrated, end-to-end framework for building software that is focused on growth and adaptation. The envisioned technology is based on the concept of a \u2018Model Design Language\u2019 (MDL) that supports the expression of the developer\u2019s objectives (the \u2018what\u2019), intentions (the \u2018how\u2019), and constraints (the \u2018limitations\u2019) related to the software artifacts to be produced. The \u2018models\u2019 represented in this language are called the \u2018design models\u2019 for the software artifact(s) and they encompass more than what we express today in software models like UML. We consider software development as a continuous process, as in the DevOps paradigm, where the software is undergoing continuous change, improvement, and extension; and our goal is to build the tools to support this. The main idea is that changes in the requirements will result in the designer/developer making changes in the \u2018design model\u2019 that will result in automatically generated changes in the generated artifacts, or changes in the target system, at run-time, as needed.</p>\n<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assist with modeling and analysis of discipline-specific engineering problems.</li>\n<li>Assist PI and/or System Architect with the development and maintenance of discipline-specific software systems and/or engineering tools to support project and research goals.</li>\n<li>Perform engineering and/or software design, implementation, analysis, maintenance, or experimentation as directed by PI and lead Engineers.</li>\n<li>Adhere to existing technical standards and recommend or develop new standards, as applicable.</li>\n<li>Prepare technical documentation for work products of project.</li>\n<li>Maintain familiarity with and expertise in emerging technologies and techniques related to project and research goals.</li>\n<li>Provide PI and /or System Architect with accurate documentation of all systems within project research area of direct involvement or responsibility.</li>\n<li>Provide PI and/or System Architect with data to assist in evaluation of project research direction and progress, providing input on solutions as necessary.</li>\n<li>Provide PI and /or System Architect with daily documentation of work performed.</li>\n<li>Effectively deliver technical progress reports and presentations in written and oral forms to project research staff and faculty.</li>\n<li>Communicate regularly, effectively, and professionally with PI, System Architect, and research team.</li>\n<li>Share research knowledge, product, and processes with PI, System Architect, and research team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Profile of an Ideal Candidate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Bachelor\u2019s Degree in computer science or engineering is necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following skills are necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solid, established skills in software system development, modeling, and/or systems engineering.</li>\n<li>Ability to design, implement, test, document, and maintain software.</li>\n<li>Practical knowledge of software development tools, programming languages (e.g., C/C++, Java, Python, Matlab, C#, among others), databases, and web technologies, as needed by project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following skills are a plus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with the development of embedded systems.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of basics of machine learning techniques.</li>\n<li>Familiarity with the concepts of autonomy and autonomous cyber-physical systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Commitment to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion\nVanderbilt University is committed to achieving the goal of a diverse and inclusive academic community of faculty, staff, and students.
